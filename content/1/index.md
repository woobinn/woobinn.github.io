The world has been shaken by the advent of the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic crisis it has caused. While the impact of the pandemic has been felt all over the world, one of the countries that has been hit the hardest is North Korea. The country is already in the midst of a long-standing famine crisis and the added economic strain due to the pandemic has only made the situation worse.



## Introduction to North Korea's Economic Struggles

North Korea is one of the most isolated countries in the world and its economy is highly dependent on foreign aid and trade (mostly China and Russia). While the country has been experiencing economic struggles for decades, the situation has only become worse in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The North Korean economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks, and due to its lack of access to global markets and the stringent sanctions imposed on it, the country is unable to respond effectively to the pandemic. This has led to a severe economic crisis in the country, with the government struggling to meet the basic needs of its citizens.



## Overview of North Korea's Famine Crisis

North Korea has been in the midst of a long-standing famine crisis since the mid-1990s, and the situation has only been exacerbated by the pandemic. The country has been struggling to feed its citizens for years, with food shortages and malnutrition being a major issue in the country. The famine, known as the "Arduous March", has been caused by a variety of factors, including economic mismanagement, the collapse of the Soviet Union, natural disasters, and international sanctions.



## Causes of North Korea's Economic Struggles

The North Korean economy has been struggling for a long time due to a variety of factors. The country has been under a regime of international sanctions for decades, which has severely limited its access to global markets and crippled its ability to trade. This has led to a lack of economic growth and a lack of resources for the government to provide for its citizens. In addition, the country has suffered from economic mismanagement, with the government failing to implement reforms and invest in the economy, resulting in a stagnant economy.



## Impact of COVID-19 on North Korea's Economy

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on North Korea's economy has been devastating. The country has been cut off from the global economy, with international sanctions making it even more difficult for the country to access global markets. In addition, the pandemic has led to a decrease in the amount of global aid the country receives, as well as a decrease in revenue from tourism, which has been a major source of income for the country. This has resulted in an even greater strain on the country's economy, with the government struggling to meet the basic needs of its citizens.



## Challenges to Overcome North Korea's Economic Struggles

The North Korean economy is facing a variety of challenges in its attempt to overcome its economic struggles. The government is struggling to provide for its citizens due to a lack of resources and the country's isolation from the global economy. In addition, the country is facing a severe food scarcity due to the famine and the pandemic. The government is also facing the challenge of implementing economic reforms to improve the country's economic situation.



## North Korea's Food Scarcity and Starvation

The food scarcity and starvation in North Korea has been a major issue for decades. This has been exacerbated by the pandemic, with the country's isolation from the global economy making it even more difficult for the country to access food. The government is struggling to provide for its citizens, and the food shortages have led to a severe malnutrition crisis in the country. The situation is only getting worse, and it is estimated that the country could be facing a famine by 2023 if the crisis is not addressed.



## The Role of Sanctions in North Korea's Economic Struggles

The international sanctions imposed on North Korea have been a major factor in the country's economic struggles. The sanctions have greatly limited the country's ability to access global markets and have crippled its economy. In addition, the sanctions have made it even more difficult for the country to receive aid from other countries, which has only exacerbated the food scarcity and starvation in the country.



## International Response to North Korea's Economic Struggles

The international community has been responding to North Korea's economic struggles. The United Nations has been providing humanitarian aid to the country, while a number of countries, including China and South Korea, have been providing aid in the form of food and medical supplies. In addition, the international community has been calling for the lifting of sanctions on North Korea to help the country access global markets and aid.



## North Korea's Potential Economic Recovery

Despite the dire situation in North Korea, there is still hope for the country's economic recovery. The government has recently implemented a number of economic reforms, such as liberalizing its currency and allowing foreign investment. In addition, the country has been trying to improve its ties with the international community, which could open up new trade opportunities for the country. These reforms could help the country access global aid and resources and enable it to start rebuilding its economy.



## Conclusion

North Korea is facing an incredibly difficult economic situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the long-standing famine crisis. The government is struggling to provide for its citizens due to the food scarcity, starvation and lack of access to global markets. The international community has been responding to the crisis and providing aid, but more needs to be done to help the country overcome its economic struggles. With the right reforms and international support, North Korea has the potential to overcome its economic crisis and start rebuilding its economy.
